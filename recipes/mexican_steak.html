  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This is a great way to serve skirt or flank steak. The two day marinade is worth the wait.  </p>
  <h2>Ingredient</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2 cup cumin seeds</li>
    <li>5 jalapeno peppers, seeds and ribs removed, chopped</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1 tbsp cracked black pepper</li>
    <li>1/3 cup fresh lime juice</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups olive oil</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Toast the cumin seeds in a medium saute pan over medium-low heat for 5 minutes, or until fragrant.</li>
    <li>In a blender, combine the cumin seeds, jalapenos, garlic, pepper, lime juice, and salt. Pulse the blender to finely chop ingredients. Add the oil and cilantro and puree until smooth.</li>
    <li>Lightly score both sides of the meat with a knife so that the marinade will penetrate. Place the meat in a large plastic bag or bowl, pour in the marinade, and coat well. Marinate in the refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours.</li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
    <li>Remove the meat from the marinade and discard the remaining marinade. Cook on high, 1 to 2 minutes per side, to sear the meat. Turn the heat down to low and cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until the it has reached the desired doneness.</li>
  </ol>
